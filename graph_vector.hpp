// This class holds the data for the entire graph, edges are held in struct vertex,
// and nodes are held in struct node. It is important to note that this implementation
// means that the graph is directed, so for this project, which has an undirected graph
// two vertices nead to be updates when adding a vertex.
// 
// struct vertex_queue exists because of how the data is read in. Looking at the
// topology.dat file, the edges and nodes are supplied in one file, and it is not possible
// to add edges if the nodes that they reference have not been added to the graph yet.
// 
// The class is used as follows. Call add_to_graph() to add each node and edge, then call
// flush_queue() to populate the edges from struct_vertex.
